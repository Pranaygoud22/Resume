Dog Breed Detection System -                  
NOV 2024 
SEPT 2024 
• The Dog Breed Detection System is a machine learning-based application designed to identify the 
breed of a dog from an input image. This system leverages deep learning techniques, particularly 
convolutional neural networks (CNN), to classify images of dogs into various breed categories with 
high accuracy. 
• Image Input: Accepts a single image of a dog as input. 
• Breed Classification: Detects and classifies the breed of the dog from the image. 
• Deep Learning Model: Uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network for feature extraction and 
classification.
